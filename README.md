#### This is a malaria prediction image classification project where I created a cnn model from scratch where I could a accuracy of about 96 percent

#### To check the model building check Malaria Detection.ipynb
#### I made a web app using Streamlit library and also deployed the model on streamlit cloud [Link Here](https://mohantyrohan3-malaria-detection--app-j8fsaw.streamlit.app/)  (It takes some time to load depending upon the internet connection)
